# Project name: HER NEWS

# Brief description: 
HER NEWS is a dApp where our users can find trends, news about blockchain and web3, and monetization opportunities of their data, in a single place. It is imperative for DAOs and other Web3 organizations to ensure full ownership of their content, data, and resources to better serve their communities. With iExec technology we made it possible.

# How does it work?
- To connect the user needs only one crypto wallet
- To read the editions of the newsletter click on Learn more
- To monetize your data you must click on Get Started and complete the categories according to your interests. Is a process of Data recopilation, without revealing sensitive information like name, telephone number, nationality, etc. The dApp used Data Protector and Web3 mail finally to ensure the encryption of user data, including their email. It should allow for audience targeting based on interests without exposing off-chain identities.

For example: Student, Development, Searching for a full time job, from Latam, and <18 years old. Last step is to authorize how many times I want to share my data with protocols and receive emails with the encrypted data using only my crypto wallet registered on the platform.

- If you are registered, it is possible to show number of campaigns in which you has participated, tokens, setting.
- Protocol page is where the partners would shared his notifications like a email. It should enable users to receive exclusive content without sharing personal information. Once the wallet is connected, Her News recognizes that it is registered as a protocol, and allows you to select the category of interest such as Marketing or Legal. Once the category is selected, the dApp will show the pool categorization or number of crypto wallets that are registered in that category, you must select one, add email subject and a message to send emails to users.

# What technology do we use?
1. Users pool categorization: According users data: occupations, categories, searching, region, age.
2. Data protector: Encryption of name´s users and their emails.
3. Web3 email: Send email to registered wallet without show the user's email.
4. Receiver pool categorization: According user data and how many times they want to receive web3 email.
