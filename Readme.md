# Project name: HER NEWS

# Brief description: 
HER NEWS is a dApp where our users can find trends, news about blockchain and web3, and monetization opportunities of their data, in a single place. The HER community is participatory, recently has a newsletter based on Substack, which only promotes reading by users on another web3 platform. Ownership is the very core of Web3. Given the recent anti-crypto moves by not only by the world lead governments, but by mainstream tech companies (read: the mailchimp case), it is imperative for DAOs and other Web3 organizations to ensure full ownership of their content, data, and resources to better serve their communities. With iExec technology we made it possible.

# What technology do we use?
1. Users pool categorization: According users data: occupations, categories, searching, region, age.
2. Data protector: Encryption of nameÂ´s users and their emails.
3. Web3 email: Send email to registered wallet without show the user's email.
4. Receiver pool categorization: According user data and how many times they want to receive web3 email.

# Local installation
Yarn install
NPM: to check the list of users whose data we have stored.
Web3mail is directly utilized in the iExec platform
The project is run using `yarn start`.
